# GreyWarden Maintenance Plan

## Goal

Improve maintainability without changing gameplay behavior:

- Reduce behavior classes that mix dialogue, AI, state, and persistence.
- Reduce cross-file coupling caused by runtime static state and timing-sensitive logic.
- Centralize IDs, tuning values, and text ownership.
- Make hidden state machines easier to read and extend.

## Phase 1

Split dialogue responsibilities out of `PoliceEnforcementBehavior`.

Status:
- Completed

Done:
- Moved enforcement dialogue registration, dialogue conditions, and dialogue consequences into a separate partial file.
- Kept enforcement state progression and punishment flow in the core behavior file.
- Preserved existing gameplay behavior.

## Phase 2

Split dialogue and notification responsibilities out of `PlayerBountyBehavior`.

Status:
- Completed

Done:
- Moved recruitment dialogue, bounty reward dialogue, and map-notification flow into a separate partial file.
- Kept bounty state progression, escort AI control, and quest recovery in the core behavior file.
- Cleaned a batch of low-risk nullable warnings in the touched bounty files.

## Phase 3

Centralize shared IDs, tuning values, and text keys.

Status:
- Completed

Scope:
- Introduce `GwpIds` for hero, clan, item, party, and text keys.
- Introduce `GwpTuning` for reputation thresholds, cooldowns, rewards, and timing values.

Done:
- Added `GwpIds`, `GwpTuning`, and `GwpTextKeys` as shared constant entry points.
- Replaced scattered literals in core bounty, enforcement, patrol, resource, lore, and submodule files.
- Reduced warning count further while touching those files.

## Phase 4

Unify runtime state access.

Scope:
- Add a single runtime entry point for `CrimePool` and `PlayerBehaviorPool`.
- Centralize new-game init, load recovery, and session reconnect behavior.

## Phase 5

Make core state machines explicit.

Scope:
- Introduce explicit enums for enforcement, bounty, and atonement flows.
- Reduce branching built from `bool + string + null` combinations.

## Constraints

- Each phase must compile before moving on.
- Prefer structural refactors before gameplay changes.
- Keep refactors incremental so in-game regression testing stays practical.
