# GreyWarden Maintenance Plan

## Goal

Improve maintainability without changing gameplay behavior:

- Reduce behavior classes that mix dialogue, AI, state, and persistence.
- Reduce cross-file coupling caused by runtime static state and timing-sensitive logic.
- Centralize IDs, tuning values, and text ownership.
- Make hidden state machines easier to read and extend.

## Phase 1

Split dialogue responsibilities out of `PoliceEnforcementBehavior`.

Status:
- Completed

Done:
- Moved enforcement dialogue registration, dialogue conditions, and dialogue consequences into a separate partial file.
- Kept enforcement state progression and punishment flow in the core behavior file.
- Preserved existing gameplay behavior.

## Phase 2

Split dialogue and notification responsibilities out of `PlayerBountyBehavior`.

Status:
- Completed

Done:
- Moved recruitment dialogue, bounty reward dialogue, and map-notification flow into a separate partial file.
- Kept bounty state progression, escort AI control, and quest recovery in the core behavior file.
- Cleaned a batch of low-risk nullable warnings in the touched bounty files.

## Phase 3

Centralize shared IDs, tuning values, and text keys.

Status:
- Completed

Scope:
- Introduce `GwpIds` for hero, clan, item, party, and text keys.
- Introduce `GwpTuning` for reputation thresholds, cooldowns, rewards, and timing values.

Done:
- Added `GwpIds`, `GwpTuning`, and `GwpTextKeys` as shared constant entry points.
- Replaced scattered literals in core bounty, enforcement, patrol, resource, lore, and submodule files.
- Reduced warning count further while touching those files.

## Phase 4

Unify runtime state access.

Status:
- Completed

Scope:
- Add a single runtime entry point for `CrimePool` and `PlayerBehaviorPool`.
- Centralize new-game init, load recovery, and session reconnect behavior.

Done:
- Added `GwpRuntimeState` as a thin runtime facade over `CrimePool` and `PlayerBehaviorPool`.
- Moved new-game reset and player-behavior load/save flow behind the unified runtime entry point.
- Switched core bounty, lore, patrol, and enforcement behaviors to read runtime state through the facade.

## Phase 5

Make core state machines explicit.

Status:
- Completed

Scope:
- Introduce explicit enums for enforcement, bounty, and atonement flows.
- Reduce branching built from `bool + string + null` combinations.

Done:
- Added shared flow enums for atonement, bounty, and police task states.
- Replaced core enforcement and bounty branch checks with explicit state helpers.
- Added a computed `PoliceTask.FlowState` so escort, war, and pursuit paths are easier to read at call sites.

## Constraints

- Each phase must compile before moving on.
- Prefer structural refactors before gameplay changes.
- Keep refactors incremental so in-game regression testing stays practical.

## Player-facing release log rule

- Every player-visible gameplay, balance, feedback, compatibility, or content
  change must update `_Module/README.md` in the same change.
- Write the `最近更新` section from the player's point of view: state what the
  player will see, what can affect their character or units, and the exact
  chances, ranges, damage, cooldowns, or other values that matter in play.
- Clearly separate ordinary behavior, exceptional behavior such as an item
  breaking, and unchanged behavior. Do not hide player-visible consequences
  behind implementation terms such as callbacks, patches, or synthetic blows.
- Keep developer-only build, asset-publishing, and debugging procedures in this
  maintenance document rather than in the release notes shipped to players.

## Working-directory/live-module synchronization rule

- During development, deployable files under `_Module` and their counterparts
  in `D:\steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\GreyWarden`
  must be byte-for-byte identical before an in-game test is accepted.
- Git publication is a separate release step. The working tree may remain
  uncommitted during development; the local Git commit and GitHub are updated
  together only when the user requests an upload or release.
- Sync from the working directory to the live module after each runtime-file
  change, then verify SHA-256 hashes. The MSBuild `CopyModuleData` target is the
  canonical non-build copy path.
- Exclude editor-only `Assets`, `AssetSources`, and `RuntimeDataCache` from the
  normal-client live module. Live-only compiled `bin` and generated `Shaders`
  are not source-mirror violations.
- Update this maintenance document with material deployments, experiments,
  failures, conclusions, asset locations, and rollback information as work
  proceeds; do not rely on chat history.

## 2026-07-16 Bannerlord 1.4.7 startup-error isolation

- A later controlled launcher comparison materially narrowed the shutdown
  failure. The Chinese-site Mod Manager writes
  `bin\Win64_Shipping_Client\ModMasterStarter.bat` and directly launches
  `Bannerlord.exe` with `/anticheat`. It also orders the official modules as
  `Native, SandBoxCore, CustomBattle, Sandbox, StoryMode, BirthAndDeath,
  FastMode`, rather than the official launcher's observed order
  `Native, SandBoxCore, BirthAndDeath, CustomBattle, FastMode, Sandbox,
  StoryMode`.
- Two otherwise GreyWarden-only manager-style runs, PID `9752` at 20:59 and PID
  `32964` at 21:07, used the reordered list plus `/anticheat` and crashed during
  native shutdown in `TaleWorlds.Native.dll` with `0xc0000005` after
  `Managed Interface deleted`.
- Two later official-style runs, PID `28696` at 21:16 and PID `39268` at 21:20,
  used the official module order without `/anticheat` and produced no Windows
  Error Reporting crash. Both printed a non-fatal `Non-Zero Device Reference
  Count` line (`ERC1513` and `ERC1567` respectively).
- Therefore the immediate reproducible difference is the launch command built
  by the Chinese-site manager, specifically its module ordering and/or forced
  `/anticheat` flag. Do not attribute this comparison to the shield LOD package
  without a separate controlled test. For current testing, prefer the official
  launcher. If further isolation is required, vary module order and
  `/anticheat` one at a time while leaving all module files unchanged.

- The startup failure was not caused by the `Useful Skips` assembly itself.
  Disabling only `UsefulSkips` left `Bannerlord.MBOptionScreen` (MCM) enabled,
  so the same failure remained.
- `LauncherData.xml` initially had MCM `v5.12.1` selected while its declared
  dependencies ButterLib `v2.11.0` and UIExtenderEx `v2.13.2` were not
  selected. That was an invalid module selection, but it was not the whole
  cause: a controlled retry enabled Harmony, ButterLib, UIExtenderEx, and MCM
  in the declared order while leaving Useful Skips absent.
- The complete dependency-stack retry on build `117484` still failed at
  20:47:36. The exact fault was an `IndexOutOfRangeException` in
  `Bannerlord.ModuleLoader.SubModuleWrappers.Patches.MBSubModuleBasePatch.Enable`,
  invoked by `Bannerlord.ModuleLoader.Bannerlord_MBOptionScreen..ctor`. All four
  module assemblies had loaded successfully before this constructor failed.
  Therefore the immediate cause is MCM's bundled module-loader patch being
  incompatible with Bannerlord `1.4.7`, not a missing prerequisite and not
  Useful Skips.
- The installed MCM package contains game-version adapters through
  `Bannerlord.MBOptionScreen.v1.4.5.dll` but no `v1.4.6` or `v1.4.7` adapter.
  Treat MCM `v5.12.1` as not yet compatible with game build `117484` even
  though it is the newest installed Workshop release.
- A controlled build `117484` run at 20:42:59 loaded only Harmony, the official
  single-player modules, and GreyWarden. It loaded
  `GreyWarden/AssetPackages`, reached `GauntletInitialScreen` at 20:43:21, and
  produced no `rgl_log_errors` entry or GreyWarden assertion. This isolates the
  immediate startup failure to the MCM dependency stack rather than GreyWarden
  or Useful Skips.
- Current local isolation state in
  `C:\Users\lucif\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Configs\LauncherData.xml`:
  Harmony, MCM, ButterLib, UIExtenderEx, ExceptionSentry, and Useful Skips are
  disabled; official modules and GreyWarden remain enabled. The pre-isolation
  launcher configuration is retained at
  `C:\Users\lucif\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Configs\LauncherData.xml.before-usefulskips-fix-20260716-2040.bak`.
- Separate earlier build-117377 messages about `gw_leader_*` hair/tattoo tags
  and obsolete `civilian="true"` equipment syntax were GreyWarden XML schema
  assertions, not the later startup stop. Do not conflate those content
  assertions with the MCM dependency-resolution failure.

## Release packaging and asset layout

### Player archive

- Public artifact name: `GreyWarden-v1.4.7.zip` with a sibling SHA-256 file.
- Create archives only during a formal GitHub push/release task. Ordinary
  `dotnet build` runs must compile and synchronize the live module without
  creating, refreshing, or copying any ZIP.
- The local formal-release output directory is the game's module parent:
  `D:\steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules`. The ZIP and
  checksum sit beside the `GreyWarden` directory, never inside the live
  `Modules\GreyWarden` directory and never inside repository `_Module`.
- The ZIP must contain exactly one top-level `GreyWarden` directory.
- Include only runtime data: `AssetPackages`, `bin/Win64_Shipping_Client`,
  `GUI`, `ModuleData`, `ModuleSounds`, `Shaders`, `README.md`, and
  `SubModule.xml`.
- Exclude `Assets`, `AssetSources`, `RuntimeDataCache`,
  `bin/Win64_Shipping_wEditor`, PDB files, source FBX/PNG files, and diagnostic
  logs/dumps.

### Required TPAC files

- `AssetPackages/gwp_inherited_legacy_assets.tpac`
  - Size: `332,944,246` bytes
  - SHA-256: `957DD525945E3B18545242D44AC1B0C55F180060A2F917261286CB1D0CCEDE40`
  - Contains the inherited armour, weapons, ordinary shield, materials,
    textures, and the original shield physics shapes.
- `AssetPackages/gwp_black_gold_shield.tpac`
  - Size: `37,594,977` bytes
  - SHA-256: `2A572A2FD5914EF7EE84920F765CA3919CFA64D54D74764F318D3F9AD466E33B`
  - Contains `wlarge_shield_black_static`, `gwp_black`, and the three
    black-and-gold textures.
- Both files are intentionally ignored by Git because the inherited package is
  larger than GitHub's normal file limit. A distributable is not complete until
  both hashes pass.

### Modding Kit publication order

The Modding Kit clears the live `AssetPackages` directory and writes only
`pack0.tpac`. After every shield publication:

1. Ensure the Modding Kit has fully exited.
2. Preserve the new `pack0.tpac` immediately.
3. Rename it to `gwp_black_gold_shield.tpac`.
4. Copy the renamed file to repository `_Module/AssetPackages`.
5. Restore `gwp_inherited_legacy_assets.tpac` beside it.
6. Verify both file sizes and hashes before launching the client.
7. Move live `Assets`, `AssetSources`, and `RuntimeDataCache` intact to sibling
   `_GreyWardenEditorWorkspace` before a client test.

Do not concatenate the two TPAC files. They are independent valid packages.

### Editor workspace parking and restoration

The editable resource directories are currently parked intact at:

`D:\steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\_GreyWardenEditorWorkspace`

That directory is outside the live `GreyWarden` module and contains exactly the
three editor-only directories needed to resume asset work:

- `Assets`: editable generated TPAC metadata, including the current
  `GreyWardenRecovery/dun_geo.tpac`.
- `AssetSources`: the six-LOD shield FBX and three source textures. The current
  `GreyWardenRecovery/dun.fbx` is `218,316` bytes with SHA-256
  `8FC25976E9A6E5B0663A6462EB6BB2F0F59E73C14AE899671A510825AB63B6AC`.
- `RuntimeDataCache`: generated editor cache. It is movable with the workspace
  but is not an authoritative backup and may be regenerated if necessary.

To resume editing without opening or automating the editor on the user's behalf:

1. Confirm the game and Modding Kit are fully closed.
2. Move `Assets`, `AssetSources`, and `RuntimeDataCache` from
   `_GreyWardenEditorWorkspace` back into the live module root:
   `D:\steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\GreyWarden`.
3. Preserve both files in live `AssetPackages` before publishing; the Modding
   Kit will clear that directory and create a new `pack0.tpac`.
4. The user performs all Modding Kit/editor interaction. Do not control the
   editor for them.

Before normal-client testing or building a public archive:

1. Fully close the Modding Kit.
2. Move the same three directories back to
   `_GreyWardenEditorWorkspace`; do not split their contents across locations.
3. Confirm the live `GreyWarden` module has no `Assets`, `AssetSources`, or
   `RuntimeDataCache` directory, otherwise the client can prefer editable
   resources and ignore the complete runtime packages.
4. Restore and verify both runtime TPAC files using the sizes and hashes above.

Do not delete `_GreyWardenEditorWorkspace`. It is the current resumable editor
state. The inherited `gwp_inherited_legacy_assets.tpac` remains the authoritative
irreplaceable backup; the editor workspace does not replace it.

## Solved: black-and-gold shield shutdown failure

### Player symptom

- The black-and-gold lord shield rendered correctly, but some game exits ended
  after `Managed Interface deleted` with `0xc0000005` in
  `TaleWorlds.Native.dll`.
- The failure was intermittent, so absence of a visible dialog was not enough;
  every acceptance run also checked Windows Application/WER events and dumps.

### Important findings

- Two TPAC files, their external filenames, inherited collision bodies, texture
  names, and old/new TPAC coexistence were not sufficient causes.
- Runtime retrieval and mutation of weapon meshes/materials was unsafe during
  native teardown. The release therefore uses a statically authored lord-only
  metamesh and never recolours or swaps its material at runtime.
- Reusing a repeatedly edited generated `dun_geo.tpac` produced stale editor
  state. `Ignore`/`Apply Ignores` and editor shutdown could then fault in native
  code even though the FBX geometry was valid.
- The successful rebuild was made after the editor fully exited and the old
  generated `dun_geo.tpac` was removed. Reimporting the unchanged FBX created
  new package, geometry, and metamesh GUIDs. The model, material, import settings,
  and FBX checksum remained unchanged.
- Modding Kit shutdown can still use a different native teardown path from the
  normal client. Judge the player release only by normal-client runs; keep
  editor crashes documented separately.

### Final release state

- Lord item `wlarge_shield_black` directly references the static
  `wlarge_shield_black_static` metamesh and inherited
  `bo_cap_wlarge_shield` / `bo_wlarge_shield` physics shapes.
- The shield has six complete LODs, all bound to `gwp_black`:
  - LOD0: 1,360 vertices / 1,642 faces
  - LOD1: 1,142 / 1,312
  - LOD2: 807 / 821
  - LOD3: 413 / 328
  - LOD4: 208 / 164
  - LOD5: 104 / 82
- Offline checks found no invalid index, bad face reference, degenerate face, or
  non-finite position/normal/UV/tangent value.
- Normal-client processes `22448` and `31172` both loaded
  `GreyWarden/AssetPackages`, rendered `wlarge_shield_black`, completed a
  battle, reached `Managed Interface deleted`, and passed delayed Windows
  Application/WER/dump checks with no TaleWorlds crash.
- `Non-Zero Device Reference Count` (`ERC...`) may still appear on successful
  exits. It is not a failure unless Windows also records an application crash.

## Correct shield LOD workflow

### Blender/FBX

- Put the six static mesh objects in one FBX. A dummy/empty parent is not
  required.
- Required names:
  - `wlarge_shield_black_static`
  - `wlarge_shield_black_static.lod1` through `.lod5`
- All objects must have the same origin and applied transform, one material slot,
  `gwp_black` assigned to every face, valid UVs, and decreasing polygon counts.
  LODs do not need identical vertices or topology.
- Export only the intended six mesh objects with `Selected Objects`, object type
  `Mesh`, positive Y forward, and Z up.
- `Selected Objects` is the actual inclusion rule: all six objects, including
  the unsuffixed LOD0/base mesh, must be selected when the export starts. Making
  the base mesh the last-selected/active object is a useful visual checklist,
  but Blender's FBX exporter does not require that object to be active and
  Bannerlord does not use Blender's active-object state.
- If making the base mesh active after selecting all six, use Shift-click so the
  other five remain selected. A normal click that leaves only the base selected
  produces a one-model FBX.
- The verified six-LOD FBX contains six independent root-level mesh nodes and no
  dummy/empty parent. The base mesh is present first, each `.lod<n>` node is
  present once, and the same `gwp_black` material is connected to every node.

### Bannerlord import

- The FBX dialog should report `Geometry(6) Model(6) Material(1)`.
- Treat those counts as the authoritative export-selection check. If they do
  not read six/six/one, cancel the import and correct the Blender selection or
  FBX contents instead of trying to repair the Meta Mesh afterward.
- Enable `Import meshes` and convert units to metres.
- Leave `Convert to Z-up`, skeleton, animation, morph, and physics-shape import
  disabled for this static shield.
- In Meta Mesh Editor verify LOD0-LOD5 and `gwp_black` on every LOD. `Divide Into
  Grid` is unnecessary. Do not recompute normals/tangents unless the source is
  known to require it.
- `Remove Redundant Vertices` may appear enabled by default. It was not the
  proven shutdown fix and should not be toggled repeatedly as a diagnostic.

### If the Meta Mesh Editor becomes unstable

1. Stop changing Ignore flags.
2. Close the editor completely.
3. Back up the current generated `Assets/.../dun_geo.tpac` for diagnosis.
4. Remove only that generated TPAC; preserve `AssetSources/.../dun.fbx`, the
   material, textures, and inherited package.
5. Start a fresh editor session and allow the FBX to generate a new resource.
6. Verify the published TPAC offline before replacing the stable runtime package.

## Common failure and recovery table

| Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| FBX import reports zero/one mesh or LOD0-LOD5 are not all present | Not all six intended mesh objects were selected when `Selected Objects` export was used, or `Import meshes` was disabled | Re-export with all six selected; confirm the unsuffixed base plus `.lod1`-`.lod5`, then require `Geometry(6) Model(6) Material(1)` before importing |
| Only the black shield appears; inherited armour is missing | Client loaded live `GreyWarden/Assets` instead of `AssetPackages` | Exit the game and move `Assets`, `AssetSources`, and `RuntimeDataCache` to `_GreyWardenEditorWorkspace`; verify the next log says `Loading packages .../GreyWarden/AssetPackages` |
| Publishing removes all inherited equipment | Modding Kit cleared `AssetPackages` and created only `pack0.tpac` | Rename the new package, then restore the verified inherited TPAC before testing |
| Ignore/Apply Ignores or editor shutdown starts faulting | Stale generated resource/editor-session state | Fully exit the editor and regenerate `dun_geo.tpac` from the preserved FBX in a fresh session |
| Black shield is rotated/reversed | Wrong FBX forward-axis declaration or double Z-up conversion | Export positive Y forward/Z up and keep Bannerlord `Convert to Z-up` disabled |
| Game exit seems clean but reliability is uncertain | Native failure was intermittent and WER can be delayed | Require actual shield rendering, complete client exit, then delayed Application/WER/dump checks |
| Six-LOD package fails again | Runtime package regression | Restore the retained single-mesh shield TPAC and repeat the same acceptance test |

### Why the final six-LOD attempt succeeded

- Correctly selecting and exporting all six meshes explains why the final FBX
  exposed a complete LOD0-LOD5 set. It can also explain earlier imports that
  contained no mesh, only one mesh, or an incomplete LOD group.
- It does not explain the later native editor/client shutdown fault. The FBX
  that faulted and the FBX that succeeded after regeneration had the same
  checksum and import contents. The change that separated those attempts was a
  fully closed editor plus regeneration of the stale generated resource, which
  produced fresh package/geometry/metamesh identifiers.
- It also does not explain the test where only the shield appeared. That client
  loaded the editable `Assets` directory instead of the two complete packages
  in `AssetPackages`, so the inherited armour package never entered that run.
- Rigged equipment is different: its FBX must include the required mesh and
  skeleton/armature data. Tutorials that select both and make the armature
  active are not evidence that a static shield's base mesh must be active.

## Legacy package recovery

- Canonical recovery directory:
  `C:\Users\lucif\Documents\GreyWarden旧资源恢复\pack0_2026-07-15`.
- Package GUID: `cec987dc-80fc-47dd-9865-6fe9e9274db3`.
- Inventory: 20 metameshes, 18 materials, 33 textures, and 2 physics shapes.
- Models and textures were exported for reconstruction, and raw/external data
  was retained. Common formats cannot recreate the original physics shapes, so
  keep the inherited TPAC itself as the authoritative backup.
- The inherited package is irreplaceable; the black-and-gold shield package is
  reproducible. Never delete or overwrite the inherited package during shield
  publication.

## Formal release checklist

1. Build `Release` against Bannerlord `1.4.7`.
2. Confirm the live module has no `Assets`, `AssetSources`, or
   `RuntimeDataCache` directory.
3. Confirm both runtime TPAC hashes above.
4. Confirm the player README describes functions/results only and matches the
   live copy.
5. Stage one top-level `GreyWarden` directory without editor binaries, PDBs, or
   source assets.
6. Commit and push the release source and documentation to GitHub as part of
   the same formal release task.
7. Create `GreyWarden-v1.4.7.zip` and its `.sha256` file directly under the
   game's `Modules` directory, never under `Modules\GreyWarden` or `_Module`.
8. Inspect ZIP paths and extract-test it, then create/update the GitHub release
   and upload the matching ZIP and checksum.
9. Run at least one battle that renders the black shield, exit the client, and
   check delayed Windows Application/WER/dump state.

# 2026-07-16 English-base and Simplified-Chinese localization

## Scope and language architecture

- The module now treats English as the source-language fallback. Every
  player-visible C# string has a stable `{=gwp_*}` key and an English default;
  static XML names and descriptions use the same keyed-English pattern.
- Simplified Chinese is supplied by:
  - `_Module/ModuleData/Languages/CNs/language_data.xml`
  - `_Module/ModuleData/Languages/CNs/std_gwp_strings_xml-zho-CN.xml`
- The CNs table contains 507 keyed entries covering items, troops, clan and hero
  names, dialogue, quest text, encyclopedia text, map notifications, enforcement
  status, debugging UI that players can open, and dynamically formatted text.
- `GwpText.cs` is the single code-side localization boundary. It creates a
  `TextObject`, binds named variables such as `{VAR_1}`, and returns the text in
  the current game language. Named variables were used instead of interpolating
  a finished sentence so English and Chinese can change word order safely.

## Voice and terminology

- Core lore, greetings, troop requisition, bounty recruitment, atonement,
  arrest dialogue, adopted-heir encyclopedia text, and deterrence reactions were
  manually rewritten rather than accepted as raw machine translation.
- The English register is restrained and old-Imperial, not pseudo-Shakespearean.
  Canonical terms include:
  - `Grey Wardens` for 灰袍守卫
  - `the old, undivided Empire` for 统一帝国
  - `constabulary house` or `order` for the police-family institution
  - `provost patrol` / `provost` for 纠察队 / 纠察官
  - `amendment`, `atonement`, `inner ward`, `case rolls`, and `lawful fine`
- The six founders now have separate localization keys instead of the former
  shared `gw1` key. Generated female heirs use stable romanized English names
  and their original Chinese names in CNs.

## Save compatibility

- Existing saves may contain plain Chinese crime labels, while saves made in an
  English session may contain the earlier English label. `GwpText.CrimeType`
  recognizes both forms and renders the canonical label in the current game
  language wherever crime records are shown.
- Generated Grey Warden heirs are deterministically renamed by their stable hero
  ID during the existing family-presentation refresh, so old saves receive the
  current language's name set without changing which identity was selected.
- No save fields or saveable type identifiers were removed or renumbered.

## Validation evidence

- Release build succeeds against Bannerlord 1.4.7 with 0 compiler errors. The
  remaining nullable warnings pre-date localization and do not block output.
- Roslyn scan after conversion found 0 CJK-bearing C# string literals outside
  the CNs language table. Chinese source comments remain developer-only.
- Localization integrity check found no duplicate keys with differing values,
  no missing CNs entries (excluding TaleWorlds' special `{=!}` non-localized
  barter placeholder), and no English/Chinese named-placeholder mismatch.
- All shipped XML files parse successfully. The 1.4.7 civilian-equipment and
  hero-appearance schema repairs remain present.
- Ordinary `Release` build copied the bilingual module data and README to
  `D:\steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\GreyWarden`.
  Runtime acceptance still requires checking both English and CNs in the normal
  client and confirming that the log loads `AssetPackages`, not the editor tree.
- After the working-directory/live-module synchronization rule was made
  mandatory, the runtime mirror was copied again with the `CopyModuleData`
  target and verified by SHA-256: all `25` deployable `_Module` files matched
  their live counterparts, the Release DLL matched the live client DLL, all
  `13` live XML files parsed successfully, the README matched, and the live
  module contained none of `Assets`, `AssetSources`, or `RuntimeDataCache`.

# 2026-07-16 returning-patrol interception crash and encyclopedia button

## Reproduction evidence and root cause

- The English encyclopedia screenshot showed the deterrence action label
  extending beyond a fixed `150`-pixel button. The Simplified Chinese label was
  shorter and remained inside the same frame, so this was a layout-width defect,
  not a missing or incorrectly selected localization entry.
- The latest client log was
  `C:\ProgramData\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\logs\rgl_log_27944.txt`.
  At `22:13:15`, the lawful-fine barter was rejected; at `22:13:36`, the player
  instead entered the smaller passage negotiation; and at `22:13:39`,
  `gwp_patrol_barter_post_success` accepted it. The patrol was dismissed and the
  encounter closed normally.
- At `22:14:00`, the player manually intercepted that returning patrol. The
  conversation character was a `Grey Warden Heavy Infantry` troop rather than a
  hero, and the log selected the native
  `default_conversation_for_wrongly_created_heroes` line. The crash dumper began
  immediately afterward. This isolates the crash from MCM, Useful Skips, the
  payment barter, and localization loading.
- A negotiated passage intentionally differs from payment of the lawful fine:
  it restores peace and grants four days of safe-conduct while leaving negative
  standing and the existing crime record in place. The user's remaining wanted
  state after paying about `300` was therefore expected; the later conversation
  fallback and crash were not.
- The former suppressed-meeting branch attempted to finish the encounter from
  inside the normal patrol dialogue condition and then returned `false`. During
  a manual interception this left the engine without an applicable GreyWarden
  start line, allowing it to fall through to the unsafe native line for the
  troop-led party.

## Repairs

- `PolicePatrolBehavior.OnSessionLaunched` now registers the high-priority
  `gwp_patrol_returning_start` dialogue before the ordinary enforcement start.
  It applies only to a GreyWarden patrol marked as returning or while patrol
  meetings are suppressed, gives a localized dismissal, and closes the player
  encounter through `GwpCommon.TryFinishPlayerEncounter`.
- `PatrolDialogCondition` no longer mutates or finishes `PlayerEncounter` from
  inside its condition when meetings are suppressed. It simply declines the
  ordinary enforcement branch, leaving the dedicated returning-patrol line to
  own the conversation.
- The encyclopedia deterrence button now uses `CoverChildren`, retains a
  `150`-pixel minimum width, allows up to `300` pixels, and gives its label
  `24`-pixel horizontal margins. This preserves the compact Chinese button while
  expanding the English button around its full label.
- The returning-patrol dismissal has English source text and a CNs entry under
  `gwp_patrol_returning_dialogue`; no save schema was changed.

## Validation and deployment

- Localization integrity after the repair is `507` English defaults and `507`
  CNs entries, with zero conflicting keys, duplicate translations, missing or
  extra entries, and named-placeholder mismatches. Every shipped XML file parses
  successfully.
- A full `dotnet build GreyWardenPolicePurity.slnx -c Release` completed with
  `0` errors and the existing `44` nullable-analysis warnings, then copied the
  module data and compiled assembly to the normal client and editor module
  directories.
- All `25` deployable source `_Module` files matched their live-module copies by
  SHA-256. The normal-client and editor assemblies matched at
  `755638561B8568A105CB6C496250A5CC0A017C8623EFFC1F6F0798F441A7ECD5`,
  and the repository/live player READMEs matched.
- The live module contained none of `Assets`, `AssetSources`, or
  `RuntimeDataCache`. The protected asset-package hashes remained unchanged:
  `gwp_black_gold_shield.tpac` =
  `2A572A2FD5914EF7EE84920F765CA3919CFA64D54D74764F318D3F9AD466E33B` and
  `gwp_inherited_legacy_assets.tpac` =
  `957DD525945E3B18545242D44AC1B0C55F180060A2F917261286CB1D0CCEDE40`.
- Final acceptance still needs an in-game retry of the exact sequence: reject
  the lawful fine, negotiate passage, catch the returning patrol, confirm its
  one-line dismissal, and verify that the encyclopedia button contains the full
  English label at the user's display scale.

## Follow-up after failed in-game retry at 22:34

- The first returning-patrol repair was incomplete. In
  `rgl_log_36420.txt`, the original enforcement meeting succeeded, the lawful
  fine was rejected at `22:33:52`, negotiated passage was accepted at
  `22:34:02`, and the first conversation ended normally at `22:34:06`.
- The player caught the patrol again almost immediately. At `22:34:07`, the
  new high-priority `gwp_patrol_returning_start` line was selected, proving that
  the native `default_conversation_for_wrongly_created_heroes` fallback had
  been eliminated. However, the log ended before `Conversation End`, and the
  crash dumper recorded an exception immediately afterward.
- The remaining defect was in the new line's consequence: its target was
  already `close_window`, but the consequence also called
  `GwpCommon.TryFinishPlayerEncounter`. That attempted a second encounter
  shutdown while the conversation engine was creating or closing the line.
  Therefore the first repair changed the crash location rather than completing
  the fix.
- The returning line now has no consequence and relies exclusively on
  Bannerlord's normal `close_window` flow. All suppression-time calls that
  force-finished `PlayerEncounter` from the hourly tick or map-event callback
  were also removed. Suppression now only selects the dedicated safe dialogue
  and prevents the ordinary enforcement dialogue from being selected.
- The first responsive-width button was also rejected visually in the in-game
  retry: its `CoverChildren`/`MaxWidth=300` layout produced a long, thin banner.
  The button has been restored to the original fixed `150 x 48` proportions,
  and the English button label is now the compact `Deterrence`. The longer
  explanatory wording remains in the hover hint and details window.
- The corrective Release build completed with `0` errors and the existing `44`
  nullable-analysis warnings. The deployed normal-client and editor assemblies
  match at SHA-256
  `47BFC370099AAFC607BF7E07BE8A1767ED31B51B93752D3DA13E0CC38033184C`.

# 2026-07-16 Old English names and split player READMEs

## Naming policy

- Direct romanizations of the former Chinese founder names were rejected. The
  six stable founder IDs use attested Old English feminine names only in
  English, while CNs preserves the original Chinese names:
  - `gw_leader_0`: `Aethelflaed` / `梵蒂`
  - `gw_leader_1`: `Cyneburh` / `约珥`
  - `gw_leader_2`: `Mildthryth` / `弥瑟`
  - `gw_leader_3`: `Wynflaed` / `圣铎`
  - `gw_leader_4`: `Eadgifu` / `晨曦`
  - `gw_leader_5`: `Wulfhild` / `暮光`
- The generated daughter/adopted-heir pool has two intentionally independent
  presentations on the same `36` stable keys. English uses charter-attested Old
  English spellings such as `Eadgyth`, `Ealhswith`, and `Leofgifu`; CNs restores
  the original pool beginning `澄音`, `祈安`, `望舒` and ending `书宁`, `凝光`,
  `夕晨` rather than phonetic translations of the English names.
- If the full pool is exhausted, English uses Roman numerals `II` through `X`;
  CNs preserves the original suffixes `二` through `十`.
- `RefreshPoliceClanFamilyPresentation` now reapplies keyed localized names to
  the six founders as well as deterministic names to generated members. This is
  required so existing saves adopt the new names when loaded; no new campaign
  is required and no save field was added or changed.
- Founder encyclopedia prose uses the appropriate displayed name in each
  language. Stable hero IDs and localization keys were deliberately kept
  unchanged for save and translation compatibility.

## Player documentation policy

- The former bilingual `_Module/README.md` was too detailed for players and has
  been replaced by two short files:
  - `_Module/README.md`: Simplified Chinese
  - `_Module/README_EN.md`: English
- Both contain the same installation, latest-update, playable-content, and
  contact information. Release notes now state only what was added or fixed;
  voice-direction rationale, implementation details, test history, and minor
  internal changes remain in this maintenance document only.

## Validation and deployment

- The English-default and CNs localization tables both contain `510` keyed
  entries. Validation found `0` conflicting defaults, duplicate keys, missing
  entries, extra entries, placeholder mismatches, or XML parse errors.
- The six founders and `36` generated-heir keys are complete in both languages.
  English and CNs deliberately use different name sets while sharing stable
  keys, so changing the game language selects the intended set.
- `_Module/README.md` and `_Module/README_EN.md` are each `38` lines. The
  English file contains no CJK text, and both live copies match their repository
  versions byte for byte.
- The final Release build completed with `0` errors and the existing `44`
  nullable-analysis warnings. The normal-client and editor DLLs match at
  SHA-256
  `2BC151327BBFC490BF3F15B6A95507B059F3D56D2C50898C669CDA204B4A42F4`.
- All `26` deployable `_Module` files match the live module. The live module
  contains no `Assets`, `AssetSources`, or `RuntimeDataCache` directory. The
  protected asset packages remain unchanged at their hashes recorded above.

# 2026-07-16 village-relief encounter side repair

- Symptom: after choosing the custom option to help villagers resist an active
  raid, the next native `encounter` screen said that the player had arrived to
  plunder the village and warned that raiding would declare war on its faction.
- In-game verification clarified that the actual battle sides were already
  correct: the player fought beside the militia against the raiders. The defect
  was presentation-only, so replacing or rebuilding the map event would be an
  unnecessary and potentially disruptive repair.
- Cause: the custom option correctly calls
  `PlayerEncounter.JoinBattle(BattleSideEnum.Defender)`, but Bannerlord retains
  the raid event's standard hostile-village `ENCOUNTER_TEXT` when the generic
  `encounter` menu initializes.
- Repair: the direct defender join remains unchanged. A one-shot
  `AfterGameMenuInitializedEvent` override now replaces `ENCOUNTER_TEXT` and
  `ATTACK_TEXT` only for the next `encounter` menu opened by the custom village
  defense action. CNs tells the player that they have joined the militia to
  resist the raiders; English conveys the same meaning. The override then clears
  itself and cannot affect ordinary encounters or a choice to aid the raiders.

# 2026-07-16 release archive placement repair

- Symptom: every ordinary build appeared to recreate
  `Modules\GreyWarden\GreyWarden-v1.4.7.zip` and its checksum inside the live
  module, adding roughly `374 MB` of non-runtime data to the test installation.
- Cause: the formal `v1.4.7-r2` archive and checksum had been parked inside
  repository `_Module`. The build target did not generate them, but its broad
  `_Module\**` copy item treated them as ordinary runtime files and recopied
  them into the live module after deletion. Exact `.gitignore` entries hid the
  misplaced source artifacts from `git status`.
- Repair:
  - Moved the `v1.4.7-r2` ZIP and checksum to
    `D:\steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules`, beside the
    live `GreyWarden` directory. The ZIP SHA-256 remains
    `673FD72AE70A467C3336D7DDC1762AA2CDE8735BAB05A0464FD38BBF1C4CEE27`,
    matching the asset published in GitHub release `v1.4.7-r2`.
  - Removed both copies from repository `_Module` and live
    `Modules\GreyWarden`.
  - Removed the two exact archive ignores so any future archive accidentally
    placed in `_Module` becomes visible to Git.
  - Added defensive `*.zip` and `*.zip.sha256` exclusions to `CopyModuleData`.
    A normal build therefore cannot copy a release archive into the live module
    even if one is mistakenly placed under `_Module` again.
- Formal archives are now created only as part of a GitHub push/release task;
  no automatic packaging target was added to compilation.

# 2026-07-17 current archive and source push

- At the user's request, refreshed the local player archive as part of the same
  task that commits and pushes the current source, without creating a tag or a
  GitHub Release.
- Output remains beside the live module rather than inside it:
  - `D:\steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\GreyWarden-v1.4.7.zip`
  - `D:\steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\GreyWarden-v1.4.7.zip.sha256`
- New archive size: `349,278,336` bytes. SHA-256:
  `98A1FDE4E6992675AB8CA9C463EC0A1028F04FD30092F142D03D07DCA9DBA6CC`.
- The ZIP contains one top-level `GreyWarden` directory and `28` runtime files.
  It includes both player READMEs, the current normal-client DLL, both protected
  TPACs, GUI, ModuleData/languages, sounds, shaders, and `SubModule.xml`.
- Validation found no editor tree, editor binary, PDB, nested ZIP, or diagnostic
  content. A full extraction produced `0` missing, mismatched, or extra files;
  the extracted DLL matches the live normal-client DLL. Protected TPAC hashes
  remain unchanged.
- This archive refresh is local only. No new GitHub Release is to be created;
  GitHub receives only the source commit on `main` in this task.
